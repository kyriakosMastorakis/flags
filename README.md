# 🌍 Flag Guessing Game (Python Turtle)

This project is a simple flag guessing game built using **Python** and the **turtle** graphics library.

A random country flag is drawn on the screen, and the player must type the correct country name. The game keeps track of points and lives. Each correct guess increases your score, while incorrect guesses reduce your lives.
